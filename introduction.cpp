		tensor_lib::tensor is a class template that describes a mathematical tensor, implemented as a heap allocated array. It is build as an alternative
		to structures such as std::vector<std::vector<std::vector<...>>>, replicating its behaviour and syntax almost entirely. The improvements (and the implementational challenges) come from the
		fact that our tensor's underlyting data is contiguous in memory as oppossed to the "all over the place" allocated data in a nested vector structure. Having the whole data allocated
		contiguously is a no-brainer, allowing for fast and easy allocation, accessing, copying, moving etc.

		Rational: Open-source alternatives to nested vector already exist, both in the form of 2d matrices and multi-dimensional tensors such as ours. One major caveat they all share and reason why
		developers have still inclined to keep to nested vector structures, even in modern neural-network projects, has always been the "syntactic sugar" they provided and that we'll explore and explain
		in-depth below.

		One specific feature of the tensor class is the ability of having intuitive syntax when stacking calls to the operator[] and being able to interpret nested initializer_list
		structures like in the examples above.
		The way it works is that operator[] returns an instance of "subdimension<Rank - 1>", a lightweight instance of an object that referes to the data owned by the parent
		tensor. It's implemented using a dynamic span of the original data it covers, a static span of the sizes it needs and a static span of the array with precomputed sizes
		of the submatrices at each dimension, which in turn returns the same and so on. sizeof(subdimension) being always the size of 4 pointers.

		There are no copies involved, though random access calls using this method (when not using an iterator on the whole data) is slower than
		the pointer dereferencing done by a nested vector structure because operator[] calculates the resulting range in the _data buffer and constructs an instance of
		subdimension. On the bright side, we're providing standard iteration capabilities, not only through the whole tensor, but through each subdimension at any of the ranks.
		A tensor's memory is contiguous in memory and we can take advantage of far greater performance when iterating through our data this way. Preferably, users can
		use the square paranthesis operator to calculate the value range representing their desired subdimension and then access its value like a normal array.
		In the example below we're iterating through the whole first subdimension of the second rank of the tensor, setting each value to zero.
